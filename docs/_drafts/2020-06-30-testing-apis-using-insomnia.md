How to test APC Overnight APIs using Insomnia 
<!--more-->
Insomnia is a REST API testing tool that we have found useful when developing and testing API's.  We make a set of Insomnia files available for testing through the SME Toolkit.

## Installing Insomnia
Insomnia is available for Windows, Mac and Linux systems, and can be downloaded from the [Download Page](https://insomnia.rest/download/core/?), and Insomnia Workspace files can be downloaded from the SME Toolkit page
