In this walk through we will look at installing Docker Desktop, providing a standard development experience for teams of developers working on different platforms.

## Docker Containers
The recent trend is development recently has been a move away from virtualisation and towards containers.

The biggest benefit - as far as I can see - for developers is that this allows a standard approach to working on code.

* Clone the repository
* Run your Docker commands

If your project is set up correctly, then all of the required development infrastructure will be set up on your machine, and with - version pinning - this can ensure that any developer can take your code, execute some container commands and get an identical working machine regardless of the development environment they are using.
